# This tutorial for securing your browsers

## Watch your address bar

* `https://www.gmaill.com`
* `https://www.gmall.com`
* `https://www.facebook.account.com`    (account.com is the main domain)
* `https://www.account.com/facebook`    (account.com is still the main domain)

If your browser displays any red messages (for example: Security Warning), it might be a sign of an attack. Please come back right away, reach any experts to look for the reason.

## Avoid uncommon extensions
