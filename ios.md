# This tutorial for securing iOS machines


## Keep everything up-to-date
First of all, please ensure that your iOS is up-to-date.

## Force to require the Passcode/Touch ID/Face ID to unlock your device
Of course, it is not funny to let everyone access your iPhone. The attacker has a bunch of harm things to do with your phone: send SMS, read email, collect SMS OTP, public your sensitive photos and so on.


## Disable Messages' alerts on Lock Screen
SMS OTP has become the critical security endpoints in this society. With this set of short characters, the attacker is able to take over your account, pwn your life. Unluckily, by default, the SMS OTP token will be shown into your iPhone's Lock Screen even though that the Passcode/Touch ID/Face ID has been set up properly.

For example, in the case you leave your phone somewhere or be stolen, the attacker can try to reset your Gmail password, bank account or Apple ID without your intention.

It is the great suggestion to disable that feature by: opening **Settings** on your phone > **Notifications** > **Messages** > uncheck the icon below **Lock Screen**.
